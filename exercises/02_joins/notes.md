## Exercise 02 – JOINs & Conditional Logic

### Key Learnings
- `INNER JOIN` returns only rows that match in both tables.
- `LEFT JOIN` keeps all rows from the left table and fills missing matches with NULL.
- Aggregating after a `LEFT JOIN` is useful for coverage diagnostics (e.g., who has 0 matching rows).
- `CASE WHEN` adds conditional labels and is helpful for reporting and data cleaning.

### Reflection
This exercise introduced relational thinking: connecting tables via keys, deciding whether to preserve unmatched records, and using conditional logic to interpret NULL values.
