## Exercise 01 – Basic SELECT & NULL Handling

### Key Learnings

- `IS NULL` must be used instead of `= NULL`
- `COUNT(*)` counts all rows
- `COUNT(column)` ignores NULL values
- Data completeness can be assessed using COUNT differences
- GROUP BY includes NULL as its own category

### Reflection

This exercise demonstrates how NULL values affect aggregation results and why understanding their behavior is essential for data analysis.
